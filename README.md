## About

For the DWD Final and ML4TheWeb, I decided to continue work on the Pokedex I had started building. Currently, I have managed to connect the project to MongoDB, which allows the user to store data that is generated by the Pokemon API and ChatGPT. Using ChatGPT, the idea will be for users to be able to generate their own custom Pokemon, have them stored in a database such that they can be retrieved later on. Feedback on the system as it currently exists currently leans towards having there be more of an interactive element to it. Future updates will strive to make it such thar users can download their custo pokemon. Not only that, but it can have different stats that should also be stored in the database.

# Notes & Process

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->

I added a form to the site with hidden inputs that makes it such that any generated information about a Pokemon is then stored in the database once the user hits submit. Future implementations will change this so that you can store Pokemon Fusions created on the site itself.

## Process & Documentation

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
I realise that an issue that I tend to struggle with is figuring out how positioning with CSS works and how to properly structure an HTML file for the sake of styling it.
