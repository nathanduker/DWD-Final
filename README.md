# Pokemon API Pokedex Powered By ChatGPT - UPDATED WITH MONGODB ACCESS
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
An Online Pokedex powered by p5 Speech, CHatGPT and MongoDB to store custom PKMN.

## About

For the DWD Final and ML4TheWeb, I decided to continue work on the Pokedex I had started building. Currently, I have managed to connect the project to MongoDB, which allows the user to store data that is generated by the Pokemon API and ChatGPT. Using ChatGPT, the idea will be for users to be able to generate their own custom Pokemon, have them stored in a database such that they can be retrieved later on. Feedback on the system as it currently exists currently leans towards having there be more of an interactive element to it. Future updates will strive to make it such thar users can download their custo pokemon. Not only that, but it can have different stats that should also be stored in the database.

# Notes & Process

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->

I added a form to the site with hidden inputs that makes it such that any generated information about a Pokemon is then stored in the database once the user hits submit. Future implementations will change this so that you can store Pokemon Fusions created on the site itself.

Above is an image of a Pokemon generated as a fusion between Pikachu and Charizard, created with Open AI's Image generation API. This is a good starting point, but I would like to finetune it a bit more as well to provide an image that's more consistent. Eventually, I would like to move the project away from Pokemon and build out something completely unique.

## Process & Documentation

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
Challenges that I am currently facing is just keeping track of how I am sending data between the database and the client. I'm not sure if I have code that's sitting in the client that should be in the server and vice versa. I need to comb through the code and meticulously change what's there to separate things out nicely and concisely.
